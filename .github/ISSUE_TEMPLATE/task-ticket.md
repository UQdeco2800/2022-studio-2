# **Description**
**Task:** [Task Name](#3).
**Feature:** [Feature which this tasks contributes to implementing](#2)

A one paragraph description of the task on which you will work. It should briefly explain what will be done (e.g. "Implement an armour component"). This includes textual explanations of the work. (e.g. "`Armour` inherits from `Component` and will add an event handler to the player entity so that the armour takes damage rather than the player. Different types of armour will have different durability. Once the armour is broken (durability reaches zero), it will no longer take damage and more attacks on the player will cause it to lose health.")
 
## **Example (optional)**
- **Part**: Depending on the task, you may want to provide some examples of how it would play out in the game. See next point for example...
- **Armour Benefits**: Players can wear different classes of armour. Armour takes damage until it breaks. Armour cannot be healed but can be replaced. If a player is wearing armour, its health is not affected when it takes damage unless the armour is broken.
