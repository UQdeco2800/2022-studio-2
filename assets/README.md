# Deco2800/Assets
This is a place to hold raw assets that are not directly loaded by the game. This includes:
- Image/texture/animation projects in Photoshop, Aseprite, etc.
- Audio projects for sound effects or music.
- Anything else that isn't loaded into the game directly.

Warning: These proprietry formats are not designed to be git-friendly, so be careful of
making simultaneous changes!!!
